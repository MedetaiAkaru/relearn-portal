# Feature Requests for GArnet

## Outcomes

* Chrome Extension that automatically creates observation in garnet
  when observation is created in outcomes.generalassemb.ly

## Tim

### Must Have

* Grading HW - each HW must have a max score, and instructors must be able to give
  each submission a score out of that max

### Nice to Have

* Exit Tickets - baseline: each course has the same exit ticket survey
* Attendance / HW Table View (like in Tim's course tracker, students are rows, assignments/dates are columns)
* Student Profile on a membership - like a quiz about what they want to get out
of every class, experience w/ tools, could be a 'quiz'
* Marking HWs as 'required to graduate'
* Generate data export of cohort w/ members, present %, completion %, req. hw %, etc

* Production Needs - on a membership, be able to track attributes like who has
  paid, same for every course
* Production Dashboards - Show assignments / attendance in table view, AS WELL AS most recent exit tickets
* HW Scores are public or private at the HW or course level
* Include exit ticket responses on membership show page

### Bonus

* Rubrics per HW Assignment for detailed grading
* Differentiated Exit Tickets per cohort
* Cross-cohort dashboard
